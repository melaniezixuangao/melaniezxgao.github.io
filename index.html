		<h2 id="hello"> Hello! </h2>
		<p class="welcome">I'm a sophomore @ <em> Cornell University </em> and an aspiring computer scientist!
        </p>

        <h3> Research interests </h3>
        <p> I aspire to solve real world problems through computing and engineering,
            as I believe to elicit a real impact on the world, technology is the way to go!
            However, techology itself also poses problems, especially bias in machine learning
            models.
        </p>

            <p>Some of my interests include:</p>
            <p>Qualitative reasoning, fault-tolerant distributed computation,
             social networks, game theory and decision theory, programming languages, fairness and bias in data-driven systems,
             using wearable technology to track physical activites, specifically, rock climbing. </p>

<p> üíª I'm actively seeking research position for Spring 2022 semester and the summer! </p>


<h3> Hobbies </h3>

          <p> üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm a big fan of rock climbing, by that I mean I go to the climbing
              gym around 3, 4 times a week. I love working on hard bouldering problems,
              and am working on improving my lead skills. In the fall break, I on-sighted a 5.11b route in the Adirondack! I was super psyched! Follow me on
              <a class="link" href="https://www.thecrag.com/climber/zixuanclimbs"> theCrag </a>
              to see some of my sends. </p>

              </div>

        <h3> Current Experiences </h3>
        <p> üå≤Project team: I spend a lot time in nature rock climbing or hiking, so over time, I feel like I developed a special bond with nature.
         This year, I'm leading a team at Engineers for a Sustainable World to resolve food waste issue on campus. We are creating
         a website to track food waste and the portion that is recycled in the dinning halls, as well as building a prototype to
         generate heat from composting. </p>

         <p> üë©‚Äçüè´TA: I'm a frequent visitor of office hours and benefited a lot from it, so this semester, I'm thrilled to be a TA for one of
         my favorite classes, Introductory design and programming for the web. I love leading weekly lab sessions and answering
         questions during office hours.  </p>
