		    <h2 id="hello"> Hello! </h2>
		    <p class="welcome">I'm a sophomore @ <em> Cornell University </em> and an aspiring computer scientist!</p>

        <h3> About </h3>
            <p> üíª I'm majoring in Computer and Information Science possibly with a minor in Cognitive Science.
          I‚Äôm passionate about software engineering,
          especially solving real problems in the world through computing and engineering.
      </p>

      <p> üå≤ I spend a lot time in nature rock climbing or hiking, so over time, I feel like I developed a special bond with nature.
          This year, I'm leading a team at Engineers for a Sustainable World to resolve food waste issue on campus.
          We are creating a website to track the amount of food waste and how much of it have been recycled. In addition,
          we are working on a prototype to generate heat from composting.

      </a>.

          <p> üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm a big fan of rock climbing, so there is a good chance you'll
              run into my at the Lindseth Climbing Center. My favorite is bouldering,
              though I'm working on improving my lead skills. Follow me on
              <a class="link" href="https://www.thecrag.com/climber/zixuanclimbs"> theCrag </a>
              to see some of my sends!

        <p> üé® Besides rock climbing, I'm also into creating art. Check out some of
            my artworks <a class="link" href="art.html"> here</a>.

        <h3> Experiences </h3>
        <p> In the past summer, I interned as an UX researcher at Sina Corporation,
            a social media company located at Beijing. I collaborated with designers,
            psychologists and enginners to improve user experience. </p>

        <p> This semester, I'll also be a TA for INFO 1300, one of my favorite classes
            at Cornell (hence making this website for fun).
            I will be leading discussion sessions and holding office
        hours. </p>
