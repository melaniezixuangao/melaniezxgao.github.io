		<h2 id="hello"> Hello! </h2>
		<p class="welcome">I'm a sophomore @ <em> Cornell University </em> and an aspiring computer scientist!
        </p>

        <h3> About </h3>
        <p> 💻 As a Computer and Information Science major, I’m passionate about
                <em>software engineering and data science</em>, especially solving real problems in the world through computing and engineering.
                I truely believe in order to elicit a real impact on the world, technology is the way to go!
         </p>


          <p> 🧗‍♀️ I'm a big fan of rock climbing, by that I mean I go to the climbing
              gym the first time I get, so around 3, 4 times a week. I love working on hard bouldering problems,
              and am working on improving my lead skills. In the fall break, I climbed at the Adirondack and on-sight a 5.11 route! I was super psyched! Follow me on
              <a class="link" href="https://www.thecrag.com/climber/zixuanclimbs"> theCrag </a>
              to see some of my sends. </p>

        <p> 🎨 I like design & art! Check out some of my past artworks. </p>

        <h3> Current Experience </h3>
        <p> 🌲Project team: I spend a lot time in nature rock climbing or hiking, so over time, I feel like I developed a special bond with nature.
         This year, I'm leading a team at Engineers for a Sustainable World to resolve food waste issue on campus. We are creating
         a website to track food waste and the portion that is recycled in the dinning halls, as well as building a prototype to
         generate heat from composting. </p>

         <p> 👩‍🏫TA: I'm a frequent visitor of office hours and benefited a lot from it, so this semester, I'm thrilled to be a TA for one of
         my favorite classes, Introductory design and programming for the web. I love leading weekly lab sessions and answering
         questions during office hours.  </p>

         <p>🧗‍♀️Rock climbing: Lots of climbing goals this year! I wanna learn trad climbing so that I can climb at the Yosemite in summer 2022.
